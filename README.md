# ShowAngledHandles.glyphsReporter

This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/) by Georg Seifert.
It highlights BCPs (‘handles’) which are not horizontal or vertical, quite-but-not-completely-straight line segments, duplicate paths, and crossed handles.
After installation, it will add the menu item *View > Show Angled Handles* (Cmd-Y).

### Installation

1. Download the complete ZIP file and unpack it, or clone the repository.
2. Double click the .glyphsReporter file. Confirm the dialog that appears in Glyphs.
3. Restart Glyphs

### Usage Instructions

1. Open a glyph in Edit View.
2. Use *View > Show Angled Handles* (Cmd-Y) to toggle the highlighting of of handles which are not completely straight.

### Requirements

The plugin has been tested in Glyphs 2.2, running on OS X 10.9.5 or later. I can only test it in current OS versions, and I assume it will not work in much older versions.
